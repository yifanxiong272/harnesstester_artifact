# Security Policy

PR-Agent is an open-source tool to help efficiently review and handle pull requests. Qodo Merge is a paid version of PR-Agent, designed for companies and teams that require additional features and capabilities.

This document describes the security policy of PR-Agent. For Qodo Merge's security policy, see [here](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/overview/data_privacy/#qodo-merge).

## PR-Agent Self-Hosted Solutions

- Locally
- GitHub integration
- GitLab integration
