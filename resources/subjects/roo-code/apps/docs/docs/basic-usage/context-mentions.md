# Context Mentions

Context mentions are a powerful way to provide Roo Code with specific information about your project, allowing it to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently. You can use mentions to refer to files, folders, problems, and Git commits. Context mentions start with the `@` symbol.

## Types of Mentions

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-1.png" alt="File mention example showing a file being referenced with @ and its contents appearing in the conversation" width="600" />

_File mentions add actual code content into the conversation for direct reference and analysis._

| Mention Type      | Format                 | Description                                                                | Example Usage                                      |

### File Mentions

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-1.png" alt="File mention example showing a file being referenced with @ and its contents appearing in the conversation" width="600" />

_File mentions incorporate source code with line numbers for precise references._
| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Format** | `@/path/to/file.ts` (always start with `/` from workspace root) |
| **Provides** | Complete file contents with line numbers |
| **Supports** | Text files, PDFs, and DOCX files (with text extraction) |
| **Works in** | Initial requests, feedback responses, and follow-up messages |
| **Limitations** | Very large files may be truncated; binary files not supported |

### Image Mentions

Image mentions are file mentions with special visual processing. When you mention an image file, and the model supports vision, the image is sent as inline visual content rather than text.

| Capability   | Details                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**     | Sub-type of file mentions (not a separate mention type)                |
| **Format**   | `@/path/to/image.png` (same path format as file mentions)              |
| **Provides** | Image sent as inline visual content to the model                       |
| **Supports** | PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, SVG, WEBP, ICO, AVIF                         |
| **Best for** | UI reviews, screenshot debugging, diagram analysis                     |
| **Requires** | A model with vision support (non-vision models can't interpret images) |

### Folder Mentions

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-2.png" alt="Folder mention example showing directory contents being referenced in the chat" width="600" />

_Folder mentions include the content of all files within the specified directory._
| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Format** | `@/path/to/folder/` (trailing slash required to distinguish from file mentions) |
| **Provides** | Complete contents of all files within the directory |
| **Includes** | Contents of non-binary text files directly within the folder (not recursive) |
| **Best for** | Providing context from multiple files in a directory |
| **Tip** | Be mindful of context window limits when mentioning large directories |

### Problems Mention

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-3.png" alt="Problems mention example showing VS Code problems panel being referenced with @problems" width="600" />

_Problems mentions import diagnostics directly from VS Code's problems panel._
| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Format** | `@problems` |
| **Provides** | All errors and warnings from VS Code's problems panel |
| **Includes** | File paths, line numbers, and diagnostic messages |
| **Groups** | Problems organized by file for better clarity |
| **Best for** | Fixing errors without manual copying |

For comprehensive details on how Roo Code integrates with VSCode's diagnostics system, see [Diagnostics Integration](/features/diagnostics-integration).

### Terminal Mention

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-4.png" alt="Terminal mention example showing terminal output being included in Roo's context" width="600" />

_Terminal mentions capture recent command output for debugging and analysis._

| Capability     | Details                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Format**     | `@terminal`                                        |
| **Captures**   | Last command and its complete output               |
| **Preserves**  | Terminal state (doesn't clear the terminal)        |
| **Limitation** | Limited to visible terminal buffer content         |
| **Best for**   | Debugging build errors or analyzing command output |

### Git Mentions

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-5.png" alt="Git commit mention example showing commit details being analyzed by Roo" width="600" />

_Git mentions provide commit details and diffs for context-aware version analysis._
| Type | Format | Provides | Limitations |
|------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Commit** | `@a1b2c3d` | Commit message, author, date, and complete diff | Only works in Git repositories |
| **Working Changes** | `@git-changes` | `git status` output and diff of uncommitted changes | Only works in Git repositories |

### URL Mentions

<img src="/img/context-mentions/context-mentions-6.png" alt="URL mention example showing website content being converted to Markdown in the chat" width="600" />

_URL mentions import external web content and convert it to readable Markdown format._

| Capability     | Details                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Format**     | `@https://example.com`                           |
| **Processing** | Uses headless browser to fetch content           |
| **Cleaning**   | Removes scripts, styles, and navigation elements |
| **Output**     | Converts content to Markdown for readability     |
| **Limitation** | Complex pages may not convert perfectly          |

### Slash Command Mentions

Slash commands are processed by the mentions system but use a `/` prefix instead of `@`. They execute predefined commands to perform specific actions.

| Capability       | Details                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Format**       | `/<command-name>` (uses `/` not `@`)                         |
| **Provides**     | Executes the specified command and includes relevant context |
| **Content Type** | Processed as content block type "command"                    |
| **Examples**     | `/test`, `/init`, `/deploy`, and other custom commands       |
| **Best for**     | Quick access to predefined workflows and actions             |

For comprehensive details on available slash commands and how to create custom ones, see [Slash Commands](/features/slash-commands).

## How to Use Mentions

1. Type `@` in the chat input to trigger the suggestions dropdown
2. Continue typing to filter suggestions or use arrow keys to navigate
3. Select with Enter key or mouse click
4. Combine multiple mentions in a request: "Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts"

The dropdown automatically suggests:

- Recently opened files
- Visible folders
- Recent git commits
- Special keywords (`problems`, `terminal`, `git-changes`)
- **All currently open files** (regardless of ignore settings or directory filters)

The dropdown respects `.rooignore` by default, hiding ignored files from suggestions. Enable the `showRooIgnoredFiles` setting to include ignored files in the dropdown (they'll appear with a 🔒 indicator). Common directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, and `out` are also filtered to reduce noise.

## Important Behaviors

### Ignore File Interactions

| Behavior                | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dropdown filtering**  | The `@` dropdown hides `.rooignore`-matched files by default. Enable `showRooIgnoredFiles` to see them (marked with 🔒).                                     |
| **`.rooignore` bypass** | File and folder `@mentions` bypass `.rooignore` checks when fetching content for context. Content from ignored files will be included if directly mentioned. |
| **`.gitignore` bypass** | Similarly, file and folder `@mentions` do not respect `.gitignore` rules when fetching content.                                                              |
| **Git command respect** | Git-related mentions (`@git-changes`, `@commit-hash`) do respect `.gitignore` since they rely on Git commands.                                               |
