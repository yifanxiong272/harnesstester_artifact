# Using Modes

Modes in Roo Code are specialized personas that tailor the assistant's behavior to your current task. Each mode offers different capabilities, expertise, and access levels to help you accomplish specific goals.

:::info Sticky Models & Mode Persistence
Each mode remembers your last-used model. When switching modes, Roo automatically selects that model—no manual selection needed. Assign different models to different modes (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Preview for `🏗️ Architect` mode, Claude Sonnet 3.7 for `💻 Code` mode) and Roo will switch models automatically when you change modes.

Additionally, your selected mode persists between sessions—Roo remembers which mode you were using when you return.

## Why Use Different Modes?

- **Task specialization:** Get precisely the type of assistance you need for your current task
- **Safety controls:** Prevent unintended file modifications when focusing on planning or learning
- **Focused interactions:** Receive responses optimized for your current activity
- **Workflow optimization:** Seamlessly transition between planning, implementing, debugging, and learning

## Switching Between Modes

Four ways to switch modes:

1. **Dropdown menu:** Click the selector to the left of the chat input

2. **Slash command:** Type `/architect`, `/ask`, `/debug`, `/code`, or `/orchestrator` at the beginning of your message. This will switch to that mode and clear the input field.

3. **Toggle command/Keyboard shortcut:** Use the keyboard shortcut below, applicable to your operating system. Each press cycles through the available modes in sequence, wrapping back to the first mode after reaching the end.

    | Operating System | Shortcut |
    | ---------------- | -------- |
    | macOS            | ⌘ + .    |
    | Windows          | Ctrl + . |
    | Linux            | Ctrl + . |

4. **Accept suggestions:** Click on mode switch suggestions that Roo offers when appropriate

## Customizing Modes

Tailor Roo Code's behavior by customizing existing modes or creating new specialized assistants. Define tool access, file permissions, and behavior instructions to enforce team standards or create purpose-specific assistants. See [Custom Modes documentation](/features/custom-modes) for setup instructions.

### Understanding Tool Groups

Each tool group provides specific capabilities:

- **`read`**: File reading, listing, and searching capabilities
- **`edit`**: File modification and creation capabilities
- **`command`**: Terminal command execution
- **`mcp`**: Model Context Protocol server interactions

For detailed information about available tools, see the [Available Tools documentation](/advanced-usage/available-tools/tool-use-overview).
