# Using OpenRouter With Roo Code

OpenRouter is an AI platform that provides access to a wide variety of language models from different providers, all through a single API. This can simplify setup and allow you to easily experiment with different models.

**Website:** [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)

## Getting an API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Go to the [OpenRouter website](https://openrouter.ai/). Sign in with your Google or GitHub account.

## Available Models

Roo Code automatically fetches all available models from OpenRouter's API (100+ models from various providers).

For the complete, up-to-date model list with pricing and capabilities, see [OpenRouter's models page](https://openrouter.ai/models).

## Configuration in Roo Code

1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the Roo Code panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "OpenRouter" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter API Key:** Paste your OpenRouter API key into the "OpenRouter API Key" field.
4.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.
5.  **(Optional) Custom Base URL:** If you need to use a custom base URL for the OpenRouter API, check "Use custom base URL" and enter the URL. Leave this blank for most users.

## Tips and Notes

- **Model Selection:** OpenRouter offers a wide range of models. Experiment to find the best one for your needs.
- **Pricing:** OpenRouter charges based on the underlying model's pricing. See the [OpenRouter Models page](https://openrouter.ai/models) for details.
- **Prompt Caching:**
    - OpenRouter passes caching requests to underlying models that support it. Check the [OpenRouter Models page](https://openrouter.ai/models) to see which models offer caching.
    - For most models, caching should activate automatically if supported by the model itself (similar to how Requesty works).
    - **Models with prompt caching support include:**
        - Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5, 3.7
        - Anthropic Claude Haiku 3.5
        - **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5** (newly added)
        - Google Gemini models (with manual activation - see below)
    - **Exception for Gemini Models via OpenRouter:** Due to potential response delays sometimes observed with Google's caching mechanism when accessed via OpenRouter, a manual activation step is required _specifically for Gemini models_.
    - If using a **Gemini model** via OpenRouter, you **must manually check** the "Enable Prompt Caching" box in the provider settings to activate caching for that model. This checkbox serves as a temporary workaround. For non-Gemini models on OpenRouter, this checkbox is not necessary for caching.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** If you use your own key for the underlying service, OpenRouter charges 5% of what it normally would. Roo Code automatically adjusts the cost calculation to reflect this.
