# Using LM Studio With Roo Code

Roo Code supports running models locally using LM Studio. LM Studio provides a user-friendly interface for downloading, configuring, and running local language models. It also includes a built-in local inference server that emulates the OpenAI API, making it easy to integrate with Roo Code.

## Setting Up LM Studio

1.  **Download and Install LM Studio:** Download LM Studio from the [LM Studio website](https://lmstudio.ai/).
2.  **Download a Model:** Use the LM Studio interface to search for and download a model in GGUF format. Browse all available models in the LM Studio search interface or at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf).
3.  **Start the Local Server:**
    - Open LM Studio.
    - Click the **"Local Server"** tab (the icon looks like `<->`).
    - Select the model you downloaded.
    - Click **"Start Server"**.

## Configuration in Roo Code

1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the Roo Code panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "LM Studio" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter Model ID:** Enter the _file name_ of the model you loaded in LM Studio (e.g., `codellama-7b.Q4_0.gguf`). You can find this in the LM Studio "Local Server" tab.
4.  **(Optional) Base URL:** By default, Roo Code will connect to LM Studio at `http://localhost:1234`. If you've configured LM Studio to use a different address or port, enter the full URL here.

## Tips and Notes

- **Resource Requirements:** Running large language models locally can be resource-intensive. Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements for the model you choose.
- **Model Selection:** LM Studio provides a wide range of models. Experiment to find the one that best suits your needs.
- **Local Server:** The LM Studio local server must be running for Roo Code to connect to it.
- **LM Studio Documentation:** Refer to the [LM Studio documentation](https://lmstudio.ai/docs) for more information.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you see a "Please check the LM Studio developer logs to debug what went wrong" error, you may need to adjust the context length settings in LM Studio.
- **Token Tracking:** Roo Code tracks token usage for models run via LM Studio, helping you monitor consumption.
- **Reasoning Support:** For models that support it, Roo Code can parse "think" tags or similar reasoning indicators in LM Studio responses, offering more insight into the model's process.
