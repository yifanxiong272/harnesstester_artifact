 * Hook that automatically selects an organization when:

 * - Organizations data is available
 *
 * Selection priority:
 * 1. Backend's current_org_id (user's last selected organization, persisted server-side)
 * 2. First organization in the list (fallback for new users)
 *
 * This hook should be called from a component that always renders (e.g., root layout)
 * to ensure organization selection happens even when the OrgSelector component is hidden.
