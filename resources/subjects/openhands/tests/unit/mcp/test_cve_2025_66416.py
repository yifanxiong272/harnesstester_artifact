"""Tests to verify CVE-2025-66416 (DNS rebinding vulnerability) is fixed.

CVE-2025-66416: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK prior to version 1.23.0
did not enable DNS rebinding protection by default for HTTP-based servers. When an
HTTP-based MCP server is run on localhost without authentication using FastMCP with
streamable HTTP or SSE transport, and has not configured TransportSecuritySettings,
a malicious website could exploit DNS rebinding to bypass same-origin policy
restrictions and send requests to the local MCP server.

Fix: MCP version 1.23.0+ enables DNS rebinding protection by default when the host
parameter is 127.0.0.1 or localhost. This is enforced through TransportSecuritySettings.
