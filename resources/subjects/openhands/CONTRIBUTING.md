# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OpenHands! We're building the future of AI-powered software development, and we'd love for you to be part of this journey.

## Our Vision

The OpenHands community is built around the belief that AI and AI agents are going to fundamentally change the way we build software. If this is true, we should do everything we can to make sure that the benefits provided by such powerful technology are accessible to everyone.

We believe in the power of open source to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technology. Just as the internet transformed how we share information, we envision a world where AI-powered development tools are available to every developer, regardless of their background or resources.

## Pull Request Process

### Small Improvements
- Quick review and approval
- Ensure CI tests pass
- Include clear description of changes

### Core Agent Changes
These are evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy** - Does it make the agent better at solving problems?
- **Efficiency** - Does it improve speed or reduce resource usage?
- **Code Quality** - Is the code maintainable and well-tested?

## Sending Pull Requests to OpenHands

You'll need to fork our repository to send us a Pull Request. You can learn more
about how to fork a GitHub repo and open a PR with your changes in [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/forks-and-pull-requests-how-to-contribute-to-github-repos-8843fac34ce8).

You may also check out previous PRs in the [PR list](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/pulls).

### Pull Request Title Format

As described [here](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json), a valid PR title should begin with one of the following prefixes:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

For example, a PR title could be:
- `refactor: modify package path`
- `feat(frontend): xxxx`, where `(frontend)` means that this PR mainly focuses on the frontend component.

### Pull Request Description

- Explain what the PR does and why
- Link to related issues
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- If your changes are user-facing (e.g. a new feature in the UI, a change in behavior, or a bugfix),
  please include a short message that we can add to our changelog

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have opened three meaningful PRs to the project may be eligible to join the maintainer team.
The process for this is as follows:

1. Any contributor who has opened three meaningful PRs to the codebase can be nominated by any maintainer. If you feel that you may qualify, you can reach out to any of the maintainers that have reviewed your PRs and ask if you can be nominated.
2. Once a maintainer nominates a new maintainer, there will be a discussion period among the maintainers for at least 3 days.
3. If no concerns are raised the nomination will be accepted by acclamation, and if concerns are raised there will be a discussion and possible vote.

Note that opening three meaningful PRs does not automatically mean that you will become a maintainer. We will also be looking at good teamwork and adherence to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
