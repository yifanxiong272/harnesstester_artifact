/**
 * Container that reserves left/right gutter columns around its children,
 * so the chrome (statusline, transcript, panels) lines up with the input
 * box's inner content area instead of butting up against the terminal edge.
 *
 * Children are rendered at `width - left - right` and each emitted line is
 * prefixed with `left` plain spaces. Right padding is logical only — we
 * never emit trailing spaces, since terminals already paint background to
 * the edge and adding them would just churn the diff renderer.
